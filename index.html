                            A petroleum car is a vehicle that uses petroleum as its fuel. Petroleum cars typically use a internal combustion engine. The air/fuel mixture is ignited in the combustion chamber, which causes the piston to move down and create power.

                            An electric car is a vehicle that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using only energy stored in batteries. Electric cars are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a number of advantages over traditional gasoline-powered cars

                        <p>
                            A hybrid car is a vehicle that combines an internal combustion engine (ICE) with an electric motor. The ICE and electric motor work together to power the car, which can improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.
